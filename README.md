A casual tower defense incremental game you can play right in your web browser. Build, upgrade, and defend as waves grow stronger over time.

### What This Is

- Runs in your browser—no installs or accounts needed, no crazy build setup.
- Early prototype/alpha: expect rough edges and frequent tweaks

### Status
- Phase: Prototype/Alpha
- Updates: Rolling improvements and new content over the next six months

### How to Play
1. Open `TDefensegame.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Samsung Internet)
   - You can double‑click the file or drag it into a browser window.
2. Place towers, upgrade them, and hold off incoming waves.
